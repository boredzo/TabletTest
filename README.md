# TabletTest
## A test app for Cocoa tablet input

This is a Cocoa app for experimenting with drawing tablets, such as those by Wacom.

The main window contains controls for all of the event parameters, and a blank area at the top for you to draw into. As you draw, you'll see either a mouse icon or a tablet icon, depending on whether your tablet is sending mouse events with tablet subtypes or first-class tablet events.
